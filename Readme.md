<h2 align="center"> OPCovidBR : Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis Corpus of Covid-19 Tweets in Portuguese</h2>  

<p align="justify"> The OPCovidBr is the first dataset of twitter data annotated with fine-grained opinions and sentiment polarity in Brazilian Portuguese. We extracted 1.800 twitters during the COVID-19 pandemic and annotated the fine-grained opinions for each twitter, as well as the binary document polarity (positive or negative). </p>


<div align="center">

<p align="justify"> We also provide machine learning-based classifiers for fine-grained opinion and polarity classification tasks using OPcovid-BR dataset. For polarity classification, we tested a cross-domain strategy in order to measure the performance of the classifiers among different domains. For fine-grained opinion identification, we created a taxonomy of aspects and employed them in conjunction with machine learning methods. Based on the obtained results, we found that the cross-domain method improved the results for polarity classification task. However, the use of a domain taxonomy presented competitive results for fine-grained opinion identification in Portuguese. </p>
