<h2 align="center"> OPCovidBR : Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis Corpus of Covid-19 Tweets in Portuguese</h2>  
<br>
<p align="justify"> The OPCovidBr is the first dataset of Twitter data annotated with fine-grained opinions and sentiment polarity in Brazilian Portuguese. We extracted 1.800 Twitter during the COVID-19 pandemic and annotated the fine-grained opinions for each Twitter, as well as the binary document polarity (positive or negative). </p>


<div align="center">
<table> 
  <tr><th>Polarity Classification</th></tr>
<tr><td>

|class|label|total|
|--|--|--|  
|positive|1|1000| 
|negative|0|1000| 

</td></tr></table>
</div>

</br>
<p align="justify"> We also provide machine learning-based classifiers for fine-grained opinion and polarity classification tasks using OPcovid-BR dataset. For polarity classification, we tested a cross-domain strategy in order to measure the performance of the classifiers among different domains. For fine-grained opinion identification, we created a taxonomy of aspects and employed them in conjunction with machine learning methods. Based on the obtained results, we found that the cross-domain method improved the results for polarity classification task. However, the use of a domain taxonomy presented competitive results for fine-grained opinion identification in Portuguese. </p>
